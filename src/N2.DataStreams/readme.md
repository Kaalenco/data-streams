# Data Streams

Data streams are a sequence of data elements made available over time. Examples of data streams include user activity on a website, stock prices, and sensor data. 
Data streams are often unbounded, meaning that they continue indefinitely. This is in contrast to traditional data, which is often stored in a 
database and can be queried at any time.

This libary demonstrates how to use the `DataStream` class to create and manipulate data streams.
